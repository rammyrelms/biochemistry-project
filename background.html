<p>
The emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria such as
<em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> and <em>Escherichia coli</em> has increased
the need for alternative antimicrobial agents derived from natural
sources.
</p>
<h3>Objectives</h3>

<h4>General Objective</h4>
<p>
To determine the phytochemical composition, antimicrobial activity, and
antioxidant potential of ethanolic leaf extract of
<em>Rosmarinus officinalis</em>.
</p>

<h4>Specific Objectives</h4>
<ul>
<li>To conduct qualitative phytochemical screening of the extract</li>
<li>To evaluate antimicrobial activity against <em>S. aureus</em> and <em>E. coli</em></li>
<li>To assess antioxidant activity using the DPPH assay</li>
</ul>

<h3>Hypotheses</h3>
<ul>
<li>H₀₁: No significant phytochemicals are present</li>
<li>H₀₂: No significant antimicrobial activity is observed</li>
<li>H₀₃: No significant antioxidant activity is detected</li>
</ul>
